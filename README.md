# simple-backup-synology-to-pcloud
# Since pCloud is public cloud, would like to do a simple periodic backup of seletive folder for Synology without paying any to cloud to cloud service
# We use synology build in function user define script to zip and copy the file to a remote folder, which is a SMB share drive hosted by NAS itself
# on VM with pcloud client installed, copy any file from SMB share to pcloud
